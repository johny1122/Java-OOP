=============================
Book.java - implements the Book class.
Patron.java - implements the Patron class.
Library.java - implements the Library class.



=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I chose to store the patrons and the books in an array and their ids will be 
the index of the cell in the array they have been stored into.
This way it is easier to access them.
Also, I decided to store in 2 variables the current number of books and
patron registered to the library. This makes the loops run much less
iterations then necessry (better efficiency)


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
To get an id of a book or a patron that alreay have been registered I
go over a loop until the object is equal to the given object.
Also, to find the number of books a given patron is currently
borrowing I go over a loop of all the books in the library and checks
if the currentBorrowerId is the same as the id of the patron.
